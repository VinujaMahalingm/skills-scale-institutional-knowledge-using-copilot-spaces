# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains centralized documentation for OctoAcme’s project management processes, workflows, and standards. These documents provide a shared source of truth for how projects are planned, executed, reviewed, and continuously improved across the organization.

## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured yet flexible project management approach that emphasizes clear documentation, transparency, and shared ownership across teams. Project knowledge is centralized in this `docs/` folder, ensuring workflows, standards, and decisions are accessible to all contributors. Documentation is treated as a living artifact, refined through issues and pull requests.

Key roles include Product Owners, Project Managers, Engineering Leads, and Contributors. Product Owners define priorities, Project Managers coordinate execution, Engineering Leads provide technical direction, and Contributors follow documented workflows while proposing improvements when needed.

Communication happens primarily through GitHub issues and pull requests, preserving decisions and rationale. Copilot Spaces is used to explore and surface institutional knowledge quickly.

Quality is ensured through peer-reviewed pull requests, acceptance criteria, and consistent templates for proposing changes.
